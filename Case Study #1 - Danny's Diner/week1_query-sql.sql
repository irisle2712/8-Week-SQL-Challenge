SELECT
    sales.customer_id,
    SUM(menu.price) AS total_spent
FROM dannys_diner.sales
JOIN dannys_diner.menu
	ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;

--Result:
+──────────────+
| total_spent  |

| 14           |
+──────────────+

-- Q2: How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
SELECT

    COUNT(DISTINCT sales.order_date) AS visiting_days
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
